"""
This script controls the environmental conditions. It is designed to run on a
Raspberry Pi with an SHT30 sensor and an Arduino connected via I2C. The script
reads temperature and humidity from an SHT30 sensor and controls a 
humidifier, light, and fan using the Arduino. The behavior of the devices is:

- Humidifier: Turns ON when humidity is outside the range [85%, 95%]
- Light: Turns ON at 8:00 and OFF at 20:00
- Fan: Turns ON every hour for 2 minutes
